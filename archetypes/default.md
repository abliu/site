Read and delete:

- Probably include a subtitle!
- Add pictures/graphs or blockquotes if worth it (pluses: some pics really convey something well and add visual a lot of diversity, blockquotes add low-medium visual diversity too and might be something I'd include anyway, but minuses: extra size and may distract from key goal of writing good content).
